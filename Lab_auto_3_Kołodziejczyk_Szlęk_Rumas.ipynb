        "\n",
        "We have **4 employees**: Anna, Kate, Peter, and Mark. Each has a different daily cost:\n",
        "- Anna: \\$150\n",
        "- Kate: \\$160\n",
        "- Peter: \\$140\n",

        "#### Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal is to **minimize total labor cost** while meeting the required number of workers for each day.\n",

        "#### Decision Variables\n",
        "\n",
        "Binary variables are used to define the schedule:\n",
        "\n",
        "Schedule[employee][day] = 1 if employee works on that day, else 0\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Constraints\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Daily Staffing Requirements**:\n",
        "   - Monday: 1 employee\n",
        "   - Tuesday: 2 employees\n",
        "   - Wednesday: 1 employee\n",
        "   - Thursday: 1 employee\n",
        "   - Friday: 1 employee\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Employee Availability**:\n",
        "   - Anna is **unavailable on Monday**.\n",
        "   - Peter is **unavailable on Thursday and Friday**.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Maximum Days per Employee**:\n",
        "   - Mark can work **up to 4 days**.\n",
        "   - All others (Anna, Kate, Peter) can work **up to 3 days**.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Logical Constraint**:\n",
        "   - **Mark can only work on a day if Anna is not working on that day.**\n",
        "   - This models a mutual exclusion relationship between Mark and Anna.\n",

        "#### Results\n",
        "\n",
        "After solving the optimization model using PuLP, the program prints:\n",

        "- Employee availability varies,\n",
        "- Cost optimization is crucial,\n",
        "- Certain employees cannot work together (e.g., conflicts, safety rules).\n",

        "\n",
        "After solving the problem using PuLP, the model prints:\n",
        "- The solution **status** (e.g., Optimal),\n",
        "- A detailed **schedule** for each employee (hours per day),\n",

        "\n",
        "This model is useful in more realistic scheduling scenarios where:\n",
        "- Employees work **partial shifts**,\n",

        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "Integer programming is a powerful tool for solving optimization problems with discrete decisions. It's particularly useful in scheduling, where we often need to assign resources (like employees) to specific time slots subject to various constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key benefits include:\n",
        "1. Ability to model logical conditions (AND, OR, IF-THEN)\n",
        "2. Natural representation of indivisible resources\n",
        "3. Optimal solutions for complex constraint satisfaction problems\n",
        "\n",
        "However, integer programming problems can be computationally intensive as the number of variables increases."
